Die Hindenburg brennt

In this game, the player controls the zeppelin and 
tries to avoid the fire from the towers he encounters.
After 20 levels, the player encounters the final boss, that 
he has to avoid in order to crash into the Reichstag on
which the enemy is located. If the cepelin is hit on 
his way, the cepelin will be ignited and the player has 
a certain amount of time before the cepelin burns out. 
In that remaining time the player can crash into one of the 
towers, so that the tower won't spawn when the player 
restarts the game. Whenever the player dies, he has the 
option to restart the game by pressing the 'C' ('c') key,
and he can do so as many times as he wants.
The 'W'('w'), 'D'('d'), 'S'('s'), 'A'('a') are used to 
control the cepelin. With the 'Esc' key the player can
leave the game. With the 'G'('g') key the player can
start/unpause the game, while with the 'H'('h') key 
he can pause the game.
